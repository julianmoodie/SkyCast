        <p className="about-body">This is a simple, lightweight weather application designed to provide quick access to local weather information. The app uses basic geolocation to determine the user’s general area and retrieves current conditions and short-term forecasts from a public weather API.

The focus of this project is simplicity, performance, and clarity. The interface is intentionally minimal, avoiding unnecessary animations or heavy client-side processing. Pages are rendered efficiently to reduce load time and keep resource usage low.

This application was built as a learning project to demonstrate core web development concepts, including routing, component structure, and API data retrieval, while maintaining a clean and accessible user experience.</p>
